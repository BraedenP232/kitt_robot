# Smart KITT (Knight Rider)

Smart KITT is a collaborated Knight Rider-themed gas pump project built by Braeden Pelletier and William Power of Theme-it. 
It features an interactive smart assistant inspired by Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT), utilizing Picovoice for offline voice recognition, Porcupine for custom wake words, and Rhino for speech-to-intent processing.

## Features:

- **Custom Wake Word Activation:** Users can activate the assistant by saying "Hey Kitt," triggering the wake word detection system powered by Porcupine.

- **Offline Voice Recognition:** Picovoice enables the assistant to process voice commands offline, ensuring privacy and reliability without relying on external servers.

- **Speech-to-Intent Processing:** Rhino interprets spoken phrases and converts them into actionable intents, allowing the assistant to understand and respond to user commands effectively.

- **Scrolling LED Display:** The project features a scrolling LED display, adding visual appeal and enhancing user engagement by displaying relevant information or animations.

- **ReSpeaker 4-Mic Array:** Equipped with a ReSpeaker 4-mic array, the assistant boasts high-quality audio input, enabling clear and accurate voice capture even in noisy environments.

- **Custom Themed Enclosure:** The Raspberry Pi 4 is housed within a meticulously crafted gas pump display case, custom-made by William Power from Theme-it, evoking the iconic aesthetic of KITT from Knight Rider.

## Usage:

Upon powering up the Raspberry Pi, users can initiate interaction with KITT by activating the wake word "Hey Kitt." Once activated, they can issue voice commands, which are promptly processed and executed by the assistant's intelligent speech recognition and interpretation systems.

## Repository:

The project's GitHub repository contains all the necessary resources, including code, documentation, and hardware configurations, allowing enthusiasts to replicate and customize their own KITT-inspired assistants.
